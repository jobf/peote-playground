# peote-playground

Random collection of samples and demos into peotelibs haxespace:

[peote-view](https://github.com/maitag/peote-view) - base render layer  
[peote-text](https://github.com/maitag/peote-text) - handles text rendering  
[peote-ui](https://github.com/maitag/peote-ui) - fast user interface  
[peote-layout](https://github.com/maitag/peote-layout) - to create nested layouts (depends on "jasper"-lib)  
[peote-event](https://github.com/maitag/peote-event) - simple listener/observer eventsystem  
[peote-net](https://github.com/maitag/peote-net) - networking (depends on "peote-socket" lib)  

Here is a small diagram of which lib is based on what:  
```
        peote-ui
        /      \
   peote-text   \
      /          \
 peote-view       \
    /              \
L I M E        peote-layout     peote-event     peote-net   
```


Among other things, it should also show various use cases and procedures, or how everything interacts with other common haxelibs. 

Feel free to play around or add some new ones!
(start quick in using a copy of the `_starter/` folder)
good cooking!
